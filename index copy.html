Welcome to my page! Let me start by introducing myself. I was born and raised in San Francisco, and only left this beautiful city for another. I did my undergraduate in La Jolla at UCSD and have since worked in the utility industry. I've always enjoyed interactions and giving back to my community. That is why I chose to become a Project Manager. Results of my work are enjoyed by everyone around me!
</p>
<p>
I love to learn and this is just another thing on my bucket list. But I am very excited to learn web programming because of the potential to affect more lives! Oh and I like to socialize and drink so don't be a stranger. I don't bite.
